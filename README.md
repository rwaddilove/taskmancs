# TaskmanCS
A task/to-do console app in C#

This was written as a learning exercise to help me get to know C#. It is not intended to actually be used by anyone!

Tutorials can drive you crazy and they don't cover everything. Escape from tutorial hell by building a real app!

A task manager or to-do app is one of the first I always make when learning a new language. I only just started C#, so there's a lot I don't know. I expect I'm doing some things wrong, but maybe it will help you if you are learning C# too.

You may find it useful to compare it to other versions I have done:
* [TaskTool](https://github.com/rwaddilove/tasktool-java) written in Java
* [TaskToolCmd](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskToolCmd) Alternative Java version
* [TaskTool](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskTool) Written in Python
